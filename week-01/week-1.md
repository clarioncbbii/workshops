WEEK 1 - CODING FOR THE WEB

HOW THE INTERNET WORKS

Q1. What is localhost?
Localhost is the IP address 127.0.0.1, which is used for your computer to communicate with itself. It is often used in testing and development, before the code is on a live server.

Q2. What are nameservers and why are they needed?
Nameservers are servers that translate domain names into IP addresses and form a critical part of the DNS (Domain Name System), which is like the internet's equivalent of a phonebook. Nameservers store and organise DNS records.

Q3. Describe client and server: making a request, receiving a response
The part of the website the user interacts with is called the client (your web browser). But the website lives somewhere – this is called a server. A server is the website's engine. The client makes a request (me typing a URL into DuckDuckGo) and the server then searches for that information in a database (data storage of some sort). It will then send back the requested information in a response (displaying the website requested)

Q4. What is a port?
If an IP address is as a building's address on a street, a port is a door number that directs a specific type of traffic to the correct application,
e.g. HTTPS (secure web browsing) is directed to Port 443.

When you access a website, your computer uses the website's IP address to find the server, but the port number (like port 80) tells the server which service—in this case, the web server—to send the request to.
