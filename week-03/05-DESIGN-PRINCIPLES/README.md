# WORKSHOP - DESIGN PRINCIPLES

<!-- TODO: Go through each of the principles and write down at least one way you’ll use it in your 'clicker game' project this week, and in projects moving forward.  -->

# ESSENTIALS

- Type of Site:
  'Clicker game' site - a simple static game site for a user to play
  I am thinking of making it a 'Kitty Klicker' game (each click = a pet)

- User Flow:
  Single page which holds the game, the counter, the rewards; see wireframe

- Hierarchy:
  Continue to be strict with my HTML structure; use semantic tags, and appropriate elements

- Consistency:
  Pick special font for H1, H2-H# and general text font should all be the same font-family, variation in size between headers and text

- Balance:
  Allow for white space on both sides of the viewport; simple footer (no background color perhaps) to keep things clean; align items using grid or flex to ensure it is not messy

- Simplicity:
  As previously outlined, I am approaching this game very pragmatically
  Make it elegant, clean, simple but functional

# EXTRAS

- Contrast:
  I will implement a :hover pseudoclass to any buttons that require special attention; mostly use non-fill where possible

- Imagery:
  Background image of the site will have to be central to the theme

- Typography:
  As per above

- User Feedback:
  Small feedback when user clicks, still thinking what that may look like - perhaps some text that says 'meow' with each pet (click)
